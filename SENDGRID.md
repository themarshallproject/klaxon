Sendgrid requires that you authenticate using an API key, instead of the user name and password that they automatically provide through the plugin. Unfortunately this means that some manual steps are required to properly configure your Klaxon instance. You will create an API key for Sendgrid, and set it as the Sendgrid password.

1. From the Heroku application page, click on the "Resources" tab, and click the link to the Sendgrid plugin, this will take you to the Sendgrid website, which will ask you to update your email. Be sure to put your real email address you use for Klaxon.
2. In the left hand column choose Settings -> API Keys. Click the blue "Create an API Key" button in the top right corner.
3. In the form that appears fill in the API key name (doesn't matter what you name it), make sure the "Full Access" option is selected, and click "Create & View".
4. Click the API key to copy it to your clipboard. Then navigate back to Heroku.
5. In the "Settings" tab of your Heroku app click the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
6. Change the `SENDGRID_PASSWORD` variable to the API Key by clicking the pencil icon next to it, pasting it in, and saving it.
7. Change the `SENDGRID_USERNAME` variable to the string "apikey" in the same manner.

You should be all set! Confirm that your changes worked as expected by trying to log in to Klaxon, and ensuring that the login email arrives as expected.
