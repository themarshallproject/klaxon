  # routing: list of dictionaries
  #   This section provides the ability to create or reference xLB objects for the purpose of exposing
  #   the service-instances to the network

  routing:
    - alias: http
      allow_destroy: false
      destroy: false

      # alias: string
      #   alias is used in the naming of the CFN resources so that we do not have to use the numerical
      #   position in the array to identify the objects. This facilitates re-organizing the objects in the
      #   routing list

      # allow_destroy: bool
      #   this allows the xLB object to be destroyed/recreated by CFN/StackJack by disabling the
      #   StackJack protection afforded to xLB's. This does NOT force destruction, it only disables the
      #   protection.
      #
      #   Typically this is acceptable when the target xLB is referenced through a cname or other dynamic
      #   object in another CFN stack

      # destroy: bool
      #   this forces the destruction of the associated resources. This is to facilitate disabling the
      #   StackJack protections for the xLB object

      ###################
      #
      # A Routing object allows for three modes of operation allowing for aspects of the routing to be
      # established outside of the service definition.
      #
      # These include:
      #
      # import_target_group: CFN Export name of the Target Group
      #   When target_group_arn is defined no objects are created, the referenced TG is supplied as the
      #   "LoadBalancer" object for the ECS::Service
      #   Attributes affecting the imported target_group include:
      #
      # import_listener: CFN Export name of the Listener to attach the TG to
      #   When import_listener is defined the template will create a new Target Group and apply the
      #   TG to the listener. Attributes affecting the TG include
      #
      #     priority: int
      #       controls placement within the listener
      #     container_port: int
      #     container_protocol: string
      #     perform_health_check and health_check object
      #     target_group_attributes: dictionary (see AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::TargetGroup/TargetGroupAttributes)
      #     dns.domain: string
      #       Applies a host-header condition to the listener rule to control access based on DNS name
      #
      # If neither of the above conditions is met then no_load_balancer is tested to determine if an ALB should be created
      #   no_load_balancer: bool (default False)
      #
      #   The parameters below influence the creation of the xLB and TargetGroup

      is_public: False
      is_private: True

      # is_public: bool (default True)
      # is_private: bool (default False)
      #   These two are mutually exclusive. When is_public is True and is_private is False
      #   the xLB will be placed into the subnets identified by vpc-(vpc)-PublicSubnetIds-Group0
      #   otherwise the xLB will be placed into the vpc-(vpc)-PrivateSubnetIds-Group0
      #
      #   Accordingly, the SecurityGroup protecting the xLB will either be 0.0.0.0/8 or 10.0.0.0/8

      subnet_group: group0

      # subnet_group: string (default group0)
      #   this allows the user to specify a subnet group other than the default "Group0" value.
      #   useful for utilizing expansion_cidrs

      # Before discussing protocol and port designations, we need to cover several legacy aspects to the
      # configuration. Historically the Protocol/Port was inherited from the container specification, but
      # the router had the ability to override those params. With the addition of 1 or more Routers and
      # 1 or more "containers" this became a bit outdated.

      # public_port: int (default router.port)
      #   this defines which TCP port the Listener attached to the ALB is accessable on

      # certificate: ARN
      #   if protocol is HTTPS then specifies the TLS certificate to reference, Must be FQ ARN

      # http_to_https_redirect: bool

      #   on the ALB being defined.

      #   service task. If undefined it references the main "container" by name

      # container_port: int (default container.port | router.port)
      #   This is used to identify the port the process within the container is bound to. When
      #   network_mode=bridge ECS uses this to identify the NAT'ed port

      # container_protocol: string (default container.protocol | router.protocol)
      #   This specifies the protocol accepted by the process in the ECS task. An example use-case allows
      #   the ALB to accept traffic using HTTPS and relay to a process only supporting HTTP

      dynamic_name: true

      # dynamic_name: bool
      #   If Undefined, then is based on existance of router.target_group_name
      #
      #   If True, the name of the Load Balancer and TargetGroup will be left up to CFN to define
      #   If False then:
      #     target_group_name default will be stackname-alias
      #     Load Balancer will be named StackName

  # container: dictionary
  #   The container object is used to describe the "1st" container as part of an ECS Task Definition.

  #   Several reasons to utilize this approach.
  #
  # o_container: list of dictionaries

    #   Also used to name the Docker image if neither container.image or service.image are defined

    # essential: bool (default True)
    #   used by ECS to determine what action to take if the container terminates.

    # memory_reservation: int (default 512, expressed in MB)
    #   Used during task "placement" to determine how much memory the task (service-instance) will be consumed.
    #   Is not enforced in anyway, purely for planning purposes.

    # logs: string (default awslogs)
    #   This is used to define how logs are collected and processed by ECS. This is both a "generator" for

    #     Logs are forwarded to FluentD process running on EC2 hosts as part of cluster 172.17.0.1:24224
    #     fluent-tag is service.name-service.environment with the docker container ID appended
    #     Additional config object container.log_options is a dictionary allowing other params to be provided as options
    #
    #   Otherwise:
    #     LogDriver = container.logs
    #     Options is dictionary based on container.log_options
